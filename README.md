## 🚀 What is SchnarMap?

SchnarMap is a web application that extracts transforms and loads current pow conditions into a user friendly website and dashboard that shows where in the United States currently have the best ski/snowboard conditions.

You can interact with the map and see where the best conditions exist from the last 72 hours. It is updated daily cause we all know those pow conditions won't last.
